# Redux-Cart

## This was a dummy app, where i had to put all redux features to make apps interactive. 

## :open_book: things i learned
1. installing redux toolkit
1. creating the store and configure it with the appropriate reducers and middleware. 
1. using the store to manage the state of app and dispatch actions to update the state.
1. providing store in index.js
1. don't mutate the current.state.value directly write logic instead in SliceReducer
